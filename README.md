Randomly

This is a personal project I build just for enjoyment.

Randomly app has two important features: random numbers generation and random item selection, each one very useful. When you make a raffle and you need to select the winner, 
is a common practice to do a list of paper pieces with the names or a number tagged to each name of the participants, and let human factors decide. But, that spend your time 
and make the decision not a true random selection.

Random numbers generation: In "Random generation" section, set two numbers as the limits of the generation range and tap "Generar" button to receive a random result. If you want 
another result, you can tap the button again and it will be generated a new number... or the same (it's how random works, XD). Both limits are included in the range.

Random item selection: In "Random selection" section, tap "Posibilidades" button to go to the list view and add all items you want to make selectable. You can add them one by one or
you can do it by lotes, giving you the ability to add many choices in a single action. Finally tap the "Generar" button to receive a result. As random generation you can tap again
and receive a different result. Also, you can filter the result by an expression, allowing to make selectable in that generation only the posibilities starting with that expression.

The project reuses some elements of a mini library of visual components based on Flet Framework I made for myself. You can see more of this personal libary in my repository called "Calet"
